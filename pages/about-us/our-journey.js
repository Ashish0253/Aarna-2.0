        It started in 2014 when Dr Anil Rajput started a leading imaging and
        diagnostic centre in Dehradun. His vision was to provide radiology
        imaging services and other diagnostic services to patients, and to
        provide a high level of diagnostic confidence to referral doctors.
        Today, it claims to be Dehradun&apos;s No.1 diagnostic service provider.
        We are present in all the parts of Dehradun city and are looking for
        further. Soon, we will enter our next city. We have more than 10
        clinical labs and more than 20 collection centres. We have more than 150
        staff all over the city. We offer diagnoses of two types. One, where we
        draw blood for diagnosis, and two, where we scan the body, such as CT,
        X-ray and ultrasound scans. After we do the diagnosis and generate the
        report, patients take the reports and go to their preferred doctors for
        treatment. In a way, this makes us unbiased and differentiates us from
        other diagnostic centres. While we have presence on social media
        channels such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, we use digital
        platforms such as whatsapp or emails to reach customers and share
        reports with them. We also came up with a home collection service where
        blood can be collected at the patient&apos;s homes. Anyone in need of
        diagnostic services is technically our customer. We deal with individual
        patients, corporates, government bodies, and other organisations. We
        have patients walking in as part of corporate schemes or government
        schemes, and we treat everyone equally. Almost all our equipment is
        sourced locally, but we are now buying more from international companies
        and multinationals. Some examples are Abbott, Philips, Siemens and other
        companies that have entered India. The devices are usually maintained by
        the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) or the suppliers.
